# Tracker Stopwatch

I just want to know if I'm slacking or not.

## Features

* Stopwatch in the status bar - autostart, click to pause, click again to resume

## Planned:

* user-defined task text via settings (with üõ†Ô∏è (work) and ‚òï (break) as default options)
* click on running task to pause it and open quick pick:
  - select a different existing task
  - add a new task in the ui
  - pause session
  - end session
  - switch between sessions
  - go to generated stats
* settings:
  - position (left, right)

stats - dunno, what do I want to know? Sessions are stories, so track dates and actual time spent on each with breakdown by task...

<!-- ## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
* `myExtension.thing`: Set to `blah` to do something. -->
